## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to code basic HTML and CSS to work with aligning image and text centrally.  As well as working with google fonts.

Some CSS code I learned for centering objects to the middle of the screen:

```css
.container { 
 /* Centre to the middle of the screen */
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
